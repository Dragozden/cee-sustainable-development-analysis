**Analytical Report (Final Report)**
The main document presenting the research results. It contains a comprehensive overview of the multivariate comparative analysis for 11 CEE countries.
Theory and Methodology: Detailed description of the selection of 8 diagnostic variables (stimulants/destimulants), including economic indicators (GDP, High-tech exports) and social indicators (AROPE, life expectancy).
Research Process: Explanation of the applied normalization methods (classical standardization vs. zeroed unitization) and weighting systems.
Conclusions: Interpretation of rankings, analysis of group stability (clustering), and assessment of the convergence ("catching up") phenomenon in the region between 2015 and 2023.
Visualizations: Charts and maps illustrating the distance of individual countries from the development pattern.

**Calculation Sheet (Data & Calculation Engine)**
The complete "engine" of the project containing all data operations.
Preliminary Analysis: Descriptive statistics, outlier detection (Winsorization), and correlation matrix for eliminating excessively correlated variables.
Standardization / Unitization: Sheets with full calculations transforming named variables into dimensionless ones using a common normalization base for both years.
Rankings: Construction of Synthetic Measures of Development (SMR) and the final ranking of countries.
Chart Data: Aggregated data prepared for visualizing changes over time.

**Report Draft (Source Document)**
Editable version of the project documentation, containing the full text of the analysis, chapter structure, and formatted result tables.
